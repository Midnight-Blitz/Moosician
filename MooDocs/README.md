# Moosician's missing .help commands.
Disclaimer: I understand that there's Engrish in some of the help commands. I really don't think English is Kwoth's native language. (Thankfully, programming is done in English.) This is a low priority fix, but anything confusing gets a higher priority fix.

# Command aliases that will never get a .help command.

## clearit
This is a shortcut for "clear all", so I can't possibly implement it as a proper command without rewiring the command. All this does is clear the entire playlist. See .help .clear for why this is so.

## moove
Because I hate the person who convinced me to make that an alias of .move so much I'm never making it an official alias of the command. Neener. Neener.
