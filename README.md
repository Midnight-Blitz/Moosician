# About Moosician
A C# Discord bot based on https://github.com/Kwoth/NadekoBot specifically designed for Them's Tabletop Herds: A D&D Discord group from the Them's Fighting Herds community.

## Disclaimer
I do not own NadekoBot, nor do I own the source code behind it. NadekoBot, the source, was made by Kwoth and a great group of  contributors. They're the real heroes.

NadekoBot, and thus, Moosician, are licensed under an MIT license.

## WARNING!
Moosician is built to work with what's already been configured so certain users can access certain features beyond NadekoBot's natural boundaries if need be. That said, there's a security risk if you use this code flying blind. Just get the source instead, please. Kwoth and I won't be held accountable for ignorance to this warning.
