# About Moosician
A C# Discord bot based on https://github.com/Kwoth/NadekoBot specifically designed for Them's Tabletop Herds: A D&D Discord group from the Them's Fighting Herds community.

## Disclaimer
I do not own NadekoBot, nor do I own the source code behind it. NadekoBot and thus, Moosician, are licensed under an MIT license.

## WARNING!
Moosician is built to work with what's already been configured so certain users can access certain features beyond the programmed permission system if need be. That said, using this bot immediately is a HUGE security risk for your server if you don't do anything about it! Just get the source instead! Kwoth and I won't be held accountable for ignorance to this warning!
